# FareShare-Database
A database project built for UCL’s Database Systems module (2024–25), this system tracks the flow of surplus food from suppliers to charities via FareShare branches, while measuring impact on hunger, food waste, and CO₂ emissions. Designed using best practices in relational schema design, normalization (up to 3NF), and synthetic data generation.
