# FareShare Database System 🚛🍽️🌍

**UCL INST0001 Database Systems 2024-25 – Group A15**

## 🌟 Overview

This project models a relational database system for **FareShare**, a UK-based charity dedicated to reducing food waste and combating hunger by redistributing surplus food to those in need. Our solution captures the organization's impact on key UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** – Tracking undernourishment and food insecurity.
- **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** – Measuring food waste reduction.
- **SDG 13: Climate Action** – Capturing reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Normalized ER schema** following 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF principles.
- **Structured tracking of surplus food** from suppliers to FareShare branches and onward to local charities.
- **Integration of food security metrics** and population statistics at the regional level.
- **Carbon emissions estimation** tied to food redistribution.
- **Realistic synthetic data** generation reflecting plausible UK food waste trends.
